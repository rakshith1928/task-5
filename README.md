🚀 Tasks Performed

1. Train a Decision Tree Classifier and visualize the tree.


2. Analyze overfitting and apply techniques to control it (max_depth, min_samples_split, pruning, etc.).


3. Train a Random Forest model and compare its accuracy with a single tree.


4. Interpret feature importances from the trained models.


5. Evaluate performance using cross-validation.

📊 Results & Findings

Decision Tree provided a simple interpretable model but was prone to overfitting.

Random Forest improved accuracy and reduced variance compared to a single tree.

Feature importance analysis revealed the most critical predictors in the dataset.
